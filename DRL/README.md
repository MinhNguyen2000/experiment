# DRL experiment
This set of experiments explore the fundamental concepts in RL and DRL as well as their application in various simulated environments.

## 1. Structure
### 1.1 gym_exercise folder
This folder contains experiments with RL and DRL experiment in various gymnasium environments
**Frozen Lake** 
This environment is a testing ground for traditional RL and DRL algorithms alike
- Monte Carlo 
- Temporal Difference methods, currently only using TD(0) and can extend this to TD(n) or TD(\lambda) 
    - SARSA TD learning
    - Q learning (also)

### 1.2 RL folder
(currently on pause to focus on gym_exercise - May 2025)
This folder contains customized code with rudimentary implementation of classical environments, such as frozen lake for learning Monte Carlo method

## 2. Requirements
Setup a virtual environment (venv) and install the following dependencies in the venv
'pip install '
